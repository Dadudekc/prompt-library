Example Output (Based on Sample Inputs):

Stop-Loss Placement Report
	1.	Entry Price: $150
	2.	Risk Tolerance: 2% of a $5,000 account = $100 risk per trade
	3.	Key Technical Indicators: EMA (8 & 21), MACD, VWAP, RSI
	4.	Support/Resistance Levels: Strong support at $145

Recommended Stop-Loss Level:
	•	Stop-Loss: $145 (below key support level and EMA 21)

Rationale:
	•	Placing the stop-loss below the $145 support level allows the trade to “breathe” without getting stopped out by normal price fluctuations.
	•	The EMA 21 acts as dynamic support, providing additional confluence for this stop-loss level.
	•	RSI is not yet oversold, suggesting there’s room for the price to recover if it pulls back slightly.

Risk-Reward Ratio:
	•	Risk per Share: $5 ($150 - $145)
	•	Potential Reward: $10 (target price at $160)
	•	Risk-Reward Ratio: 2:1 (good risk-reward profile)

Simple Stop-Loss Tips:
	•	Avoid placing stops exactly at round numbers—they tend to attract stop-hunting behavior.
	•	If you’re trading in a volatile market, consider slightly wider stop-losses to prevent getting stopped out by noise.
	•	Always define your stop-loss before entering a trade, never adjust it emotionally after you’re in a position.
