	•	Account Size: $20,000
	•	Risk Tolerance: 2% = $400 risk per trade
	•	Profit Target: $165

2. Dynamic Stop-Loss Strategies:
	•	Technical Stop-Loss: $145 (below key support level and EMA 21)
	•	Volatility-Based Stop-Loss (ATR = $3): $147 (Entry - 1x ATR) for dynamic adjustment
	•	Time-Based Stop-Loss: If the trade doesn’t move 1% in your favor within the first hour, reduce position size or tighten stop to $148

3. Multi-Layered Stop-Loss Framework:
	•	Primary Stop-Loss: $145 (core stop based on support)
	•	Trailing Stop-Loss: Adjust to $150 (break-even) once the price reaches $158
	•	Catastrophic Stop-Loss: $140 (hard fail-safe in case of unexpected market events)

4. Risk-Reward Optimization:
	•	Risk per Share: $5 ($150 - $145)
	•	Potential Reward: $15 ($165 - $150)
	•	Risk-Reward Ratio: 3:1 (optimal)
	•	Adjustment Suggestion: Consider tightening the stop to $147 if the price consolidates near entry for too long without upward momentum

5. Market Condition Adjustments:
	•	Current Market: High volatility with large intraday swings
	•	Adjustment: Widen stop-loss slightly to $144 to prevent being stopped out by market noise
	•	Trending Market Plan: Allow for wider stop-loss; reduce position size to maintain risk tolerance

6. Emotional Bias Mitigation:
	•	Detected Bias: Tendency to move stop-loss emotionally after consecutive losses, increasing risk unnecessarily
	•	Strategy: Implement a “no-touch” rule—once the stop is set, it can’t be moved unless it’s to lock in profits
	•	Mental Framework: Treat stop-losses as tuition fees for learning. Every stop-hit is a lesson, not a failure

7. Scenario-Based Stop-Loss Adjustments:
	•	Best-Case Scenario: Price surges to $158 quickly—move stop to break-even ($150) and trail by $2 as price rises
	•	Worst-Case Scenario: Sudden reversal after entry—exit at $145 without hesitation, no adjustments based on hope
	•	Break-Even Strategy: Adjust stop to $150 after reaching $155, ensuring the trade is risk-free moving forward

8. Personalized Stop-Loss Playbook:
	•	Key Rules:
	1.	Always calculate stop-loss based on volatility (ATR) and key technical levels
	2.	Never widen a stop to avoid taking a loss
	3.	Use trailing stops only when the price is moving strongly in your favor
	•	Checklist Before Setting a Stop:
	•	Is the stop below/above significant support/resistance?
	•	Does it account for current volatility?
	•	Am I placing this stop logically, or emotionally?
