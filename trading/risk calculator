Example Output (Based on Sample Inputs):

Dynamic Risk Calculator Report
	1.	Account Size: $5,000
	2.	Risk Tolerance: 2% ($100 risk per trade)
	3.	Entry Price: $150
	4.	Stop-Loss Price: $145
	5.	Profit Target: $160

Position Size Calculation:
	•	Risk Per Share: $150 - $145 = $5
	•	Position Size: $100 (risk) ÷ $5 (risk per share) = 20 shares

Dollar Risk Per Trade:
	•	Total Risk: 20 shares × $5 risk per share = $100

Risk-Reward Ratio:
	•	Potential Reward: $160 - $150 = $10 per share
	•	Total Reward: 20 shares × $10 = $200
	•	Risk-Reward Ratio: 2:1 (good risk-reward profile)

Simple Risk Management Tips:
	•	Always adjust position size based on the distance to your stop-loss, not your confidence in the trade.
	•	Never risk more than 2% of your account on a single trade, even if it seems like a “sure thing.”
	•	If the risk-reward ratio is less than 1.5:1, consider passing on the trade or adjusting the stop-loss/target.
