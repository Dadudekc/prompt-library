Dynamic Risk Calculator Report (Premium Version)
	1.	Core Risk Assessment:
	•	Account Size: $10,000
	•	Risk Tolerance: 2% ($200 risk per trade)
	•	Entry Price: $150
	•	Stop-Loss Price: $145
	•	Profit Target: $165

2. Advanced Position Sizing:
	•	Basic Position Size:
	•	Risk Per Share = $5
	•	Position Size = $200 ÷ $5 = 40 shares
	•	Volatility-Adjusted Position Size (ATR = $3):
	•	Adjusted Stop-Loss Range = $5 + $3 = $8
	•	Adjusted Position Size = $200 ÷ $8 = 25 shares (reduced due to higher volatility)
	•	Dynamic Adjustment (After 3 consecutive wins):
	•	Increase risk tolerance slightly to 2.5% ($250) → New Position Size = 31 shares

3. Dollar Risk & Portfolio Exposure:
	•	Dollar Risk Per Trade: $200
	•	Portfolio Exposure: 40 shares × $150 = $6,000 (60% of portfolio—consider reducing)
	•	Diversification Risk: If holding other positions, adjust exposure to keep total risk <5% of portfolio.

4. Volatility & Market Condition Adjustment:
	•	High-Volatility Adjustment:
	•	If VIX > 20, reduce position size by 20% to limit exposure to sudden price swings.
	•	ATR-Based Stop-Loss Suggestion:
	•	Dynamic Stop-Loss = $145 ± $3 (ATR buffer) = $142 for more room during volatile moves.

5. Emotional Bias Detection:
	•	Detected Pattern: Tendency to over-leverage after winning streaks, leading to large drawdowns.
	•	Risk Reduction Strategy: After 3 consecutive wins, reduce position size by 10% to counter overconfidence.
	•	Emotional Checkpoint: Pause for 2 minutes before entering a trade after a loss to prevent revenge trading.

6. Dynamic Risk-Reward Optimization:
	•	Current Risk-Reward Ratio:
	•	Risk = $5 per share
	•	Reward = $15 per share
	•	R:R = 3:1 (excellent setup)
	•	Optimization Suggestion: Consider trailing stop once the price reaches $160 to lock in profits without capping upside potential.

7. Scenario-Based Risk Planning:
	•	Best-Case Scenario: Price hits $165 quickly → Trailing stop activates for additional gains.
	•	Worst-Case Scenario: Price gaps below stop-loss → Mitigate with a wider stop-loss during earnings or high-impact news events.
	•	Most-Likely Scenario: Price consolidates near entry before moving toward target—manage with patience and avoid premature exits.

8. Risk Management Playbook:
	•	Key Strategies:
	•	Use ATR-based stop-losses to adapt to market volatility.
	•	Implement a “cool-down” rule after large wins/losses to reset emotionally.
	•	Adjust position size dynamically based on recent performance (reduce risk after a losing streak, cautiously increase after consistent wins).
	•	Emotional Resilience Tip: Reframe losses as part of the statistical edge. Focus on the process, not the outcome of individual trades.
